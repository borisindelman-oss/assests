You are Codex. Use the project-manager skill to create a new project in the vault.
- Ask the discovery questions first.
- Create a single file: <slug>.md from the simplified template (Overview, Status, Requirements, Design, Build Phases, Decisions, Notes).
- Update the registry and active project.
If the project name is missing, ask for it.
